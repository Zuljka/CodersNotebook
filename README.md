# CodersNotebook

This application will provide a list of input commands and output results for some programming languages.
At initial stage it will have examples of HTML and CSS mostly used options.
Later other programming languages might be added.

Project is created as a part of college assignment.

# Why this project
When I started to learn HTML language information that I was looking for was all around the web and took a while to find a good article with good examples.
In my project I am trying to put together all nessesary information that might help at the beginning and provide examples of how it will look in browser.
There are a lot of variations of modifications that can be made on a page, but I will try to cover most common ones and will leave something uncovered for exploration ;)
